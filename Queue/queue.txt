A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the first-in-first-out(FIFO) principle.

Basic Operation:
 1. Enqueue : Adds a new element to the queue.
 2. Dequeue : Removes and returns the first(front) element from queue.
 3. Peek : Returns the first element in the peek.
 4. isEmpty : Check if the queue is empty.
 5. Size : Finds the number of elements in the queue.

Queues can be implemented by using arrays or linked lists.
